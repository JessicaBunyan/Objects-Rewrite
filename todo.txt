happy/sad paintbrush?

textboxes are still showing when not viewing a scene

still a lot of overlap in the render methods of room1 and room2. Can we move this out somehow?
- Whats the same between them  
    - footer ( though theres a condition in room1);
    - Nav and its props

- whats different
    - Scenes 
    className (could be calculated above)



placeholder images for other room


Better animations for scene transitions
    - When you return after unlocking a scene its just there, want to show it appearing once you return to the nav
    - Animation when hovering over a scene in nav-view


ART!!!

Text Boxes
    - Style to give them locations and shapes
    - Make text appear as if its being written /scrolling
    - manage state for these (flags)?
    - Pad out dialogue from notes



To Decide:
- final version of colour puzzle
    - Painting some things/using the colours is how you find out the password
- How strings are generated - randomly? Or can user select? If so how does the UI look for this 
- how do we get a specific number? Want to add this later on
    - Mr ? transforms to ms #
    - How does the UI work in terms of getting a number though - 
        - 9 pillars?
        - Pillar with a "dial" like a phone dial which you spin and whichever number is showing gets produced?



param hitboxes overlap so lower ones will get dropped into more often - guesswe want to change hitbox size if there's a collision like this

animation timings aren't right for entering/exiting scene 2 now

better animation for dropping the wrong param type. Looks super weird trying to put number into a colour


disable dragging for everything that shouldn't be draggable.
disable text/img highlighting
