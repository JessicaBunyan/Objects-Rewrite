implement purple checker
implement dialog for getting wrong colour
happy/sad paintbrush?



Better animations for scene transitions
    - When you return after unlocking a scene its just there, want to show it appearing once you return to the nav
    - Animation when hovering over a scene in nav-view


ART!!!

Text Boxes
    - Style to give them locations and shapes
    - Make text appear as if its being written /scrolling
    - manage state for these (flags)?
    - Pad out dialogue from notes

Future Scenes
    - decide final version of paintbrush puzzle
    -  

param hitboxes overlap so lower ones will get dropped into more often - guesswe want to change hitbox size if there's a collision like this

animation timings aren't right for entering/exiting scene 2 now

better animation for dropping the wrong param type. Looks super weird trying to put number into a colour

bug with adding colour to inventory

disable dragging for everything that shouldn't be draggable.
disable text/img highlighting
